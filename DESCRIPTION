Description: A teaching project for the display of statistical
    tests as well as some convenience functions for data cleanup. The
    primary components are the functions prefixed with 'tadaa_', which are
    built to work in an interactive environment, but also print markdown
    tables powered by 'pixiedust' for the creation of 'RMarkdown' reports.
    This package is no longer actively developed.
