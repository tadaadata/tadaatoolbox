The author of the package may appear to have changed, however, this is only due to switching e-mail domains and possibly the addition of an ORCID comment, i.e.:

person("Lukas", "Burk", email = "lukas@quantenbrot.de", 
       role = c("aut", "cre"))

to 

person("Lukas", "Burk", email = "lukas@tadaa-data.de", 
       role = c("aut", "cre"), 
       comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0001-7528-3795"))
