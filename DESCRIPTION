Description: A teaching project that contains functions for the
    display of statistical tests as well as some convenience functions for
    data cleanup. It is meant to ease existing workflows with packages
    like 'sjPlot', 'dplyr', and 'ggplot2'. The primary components are the
    functions prefixed with 'tadaa_', which are built to work in an
    interactive environment, but also print tidy markdown tables powered
    by 'pixiedust' for the creation of 'RMarkdown' reports.
